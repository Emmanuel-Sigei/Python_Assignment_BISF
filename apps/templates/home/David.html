                        Society often overlooks male survivors. I sought help and found support groups for men. Sharing
                        my experience has helped others come forward and break the cycle of abuse.

                    <p>My name is David, and I'm a survivor of domestic violence. Many people overlook the fact that men
                        can be victims of gender-based violence too. I was in an abusive relationship with my partner,
                        enduring physical and emotional abuse in silence. Society's stereotypes made it even harder to
                        seek help.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-lg-block">But one day, I found the courage to reach out to support groups for men
                        who had experienced similar situations. Sharing my experience and hearing the stories of others
                        helped me regain my sense of self-worth and find the strength to break free from the cycle of
                        abuse.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>Now, I'm an activist raising awareness about domestic violence against men. I want to shatter the
                        stigma surrounding this issue and encourage other male survivors to come forward and seek the
                        support they deserve. No one should suffer in silence, regardless of their gender.</p>
