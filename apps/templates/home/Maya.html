                        women's group empowered me to leave. Now, I mentor others to escape toxic relationships and
                        rebuild their lives.

                    <p>My name is Maya, and I'm a survivor of gender-based violence. For years, I endured emotional
                        abuse in silence. The verbal attacks, manipulation, and control shattered my self-esteem until I
                        barely recognized myself. I felt trapped in a cycle that seemed impossible to break.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-lg-block">But one day, I realized that I deserved better. With the support of a
                        local women's group, I found the courage to leave that toxic relationship. It wasn't easy, and
                        the journey to healing was long and challenging.</p>

                        lives. I mentor survivors, offering a hand to hold, a shoulder to lean on, and a heart full of
                        empathy. Because no one should ever feel trapped in a relationship that diminishes their
                        self-worth, and everyone deserves the chance to find healing and happiness.</p>
