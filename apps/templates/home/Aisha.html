                        felt like a never-ending nightmare. Legal aid gave me the courage to escape, and now I advocate
                        for girls' education and women's rights in my community.

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>I was forced into marriage at the age of 14. My husband was much older than me, and he was cruel
                        and abusive. He beat me regularly, and he controlled every aspect of my life. I was afraid to
                        leave him, because I didn't know where to go or what to do.
                        But one day, I finally had enough. I learned about a legal aid organization that could help me
                        get a divorce. I reached out to them, and they provided me with the support and guidance I
                        needed.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-lg-block">At the consultation, I met with a lawyer who was kind and
                        understanding. She listened to my story and explained my legal options. She told me that I had
                        the right to get a divorce, and that she could help me through the process.
                        I decided to file for divorce. It was a long and difficult process, but I was determined to see
                        it through. My lawyer was there for me every step of the way. She provided me with emotional
                        support and legal guidance.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>In the end, I was successful in getting a divorce. I was finally free from my abusive husband. I
                        could now start to rebuild my life and create a better future for myself.
                        I am now using my voice to advocate for girls' education and women's rights. I want other girls
                        and women to know that they are not alone, and that there is help available. I want them to know
                        that they have the right to live free from violence and abuse.</p>
