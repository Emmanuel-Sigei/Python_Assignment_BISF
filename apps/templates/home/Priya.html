                        exploitation. It was hell, but I managed to escape. I'm now an ambassador for organizations
                        fighting against human trafficking, helping other survivors reclaim their lives and dignity.

                    <p>I'm Priya, a survivor of human trafficking and exploitation. Every day was a battle for survival,
                        but I escaped. Now, I'm an ambassador fighting against human trafficking, providing hope to
                        survivors. No one should endure what I did; I'm committed to helping others find their path to
                        freedom and dignity.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-lg-block">I was trafficked and exploited when I was just a teenager. I was lured
                        away from my home with false promises of a better life. But instead, I was forced to work long
                        hours in horrific conditions, and I was subjected to physical and emotional abuse.
                        I was trapped for years, but I never gave up hope. I knew that I had to find a way to escape.
                        One day, I saw an opportunity and I took it. I ran away and found help.
                        It was not easy to rebuild my life after my experience, but I am determined to make a
                        difference. I now work as an ambassador for an organization that fights against human
                        trafficking. I share my story to raise awareness about this important issue, and to provide hope
                        to other survivors.</p>

                    <p>I know that my story is just one of many. There are millions of people around the world who have
                        been affected by human trafficking. But I want everyone to know that they are not alone. There
                        are people who care about them and want to help.
