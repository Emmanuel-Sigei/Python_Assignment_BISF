                    <p class="lead fw-bold text-dark">I'm Carlos. I was a victim of workplace harassment, a form of
                        gender-based violence too often ignored. When I spoke up, my colleagues and I took action. Now,
                        I'm an activist raising awareness about workplace harassment for all genders.

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>I'm Carlos, a survivor of workplace harassment. My story is often overlooked, because GBV can
                        happen to anyone, regardless of gender. But I want to share my story to raise awareness about
                        this important issue.
                        I experienced workplace harassment for years. My boss would make inappropriate comments to me,
                        and he would touch me without my consent. I felt uncomfortable and unsafe at work, and it began
                        to affect my mental and physical health.</p>
                    <p class="d-none d-lg-block">I tried to ignore the harassment at first, but it only got worse. I
                        started to dread going to work, and I began to make mistakes. I knew that I couldn't go on like
                        this, so I decided to speak up.
                        I went to HR and reported the harassment. They were initially skeptical, but they eventually
                        agreed to investigate. My boss was interviewed, but he denied everything.
                        Without any evidence, HR was unable to take any disciplinary action against my boss. I was
                        devastated. I felt like I had been betrayed.</p>

                <div class="col-md-4">
                    <p>I didn't know what to do next. I was afraid to lose my job, but I couldn't continue working in a
                        hostile environment. I decided to quit my job.
                        It was a difficult decision, but it was the right one. I am now working for a company that
                        values respect and inclusion. I am finally able to work in a safe and supportive environment.
                        I want to share my story to encourage other survivors of workplace harassment to speak up. You
                        are not alone, and you deserve to be treated with respect. There are people who care about you
                        and want to help.</p>
